Fast WebGL terrain rendering in Trigger Rally - Jasmine Kent
============================================================

The best boys game - cars racing.<br />
Nice sports cars are presented

- *Magic Carpet (1994)* - some people from conference are known this
- *Turok (1997)* - for in background
- *Delta Force (1998)* - nice texturing, but GPU has some difficulties
- *Trespasser (1998)* - dino game
- *Tread Marks (2000)* - use some features because GPU are fastest
- *Unreal Engine 3 (2007)* - nice high details in fore and background
- *Tiger Rally (2013)*

Extremely summary:
+ GPU - is good
+ CPU - is bad for graphics rendering
