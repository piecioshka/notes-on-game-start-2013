Get professional with HTML 5 - Wolfgang Litzlbauer (sproing Vienna)
===================================================================

- *7 years in game industry*
- *a lot of impressive console games*
- *last 3 years - web games*

professional env
- JS (but not optimal for large codebases - hard to master)
- different languages? (Closure Compiler, Coffee Script, Dart, TypeScript, GWT)
- C++ to JS compiler (via LLVM)

They use GWT + Eclipse for web projects

---
### Pure JS Engines
- Play Canvas
- Pixi.js

---
### PlayN - subsystem
- still early state
- good platform abstraction

---
### Best practices:
- not support IE8 (Canvas)
- webGL still not optimal for multi platform
- problematic on tablets
- it's a future
 - render full screen quickly
 - make animation scalable
- full on desktop 
- minimal on tablets

---
FPS is not everything
Think native:
- game must be listed in the AppStore
- Packing tools tools like PhoneGap reduce game perf (dramatically)
- use PlayN
Expect the unexpective
